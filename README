= ImageRuby-Devil - Bridge between ImageRuby and Devil image library

Implements a set of features for ImageRuby using Devil image library (https://github.com/banister/devil)

* Support to load and save formats supported by devil library including jpg, tga, png, etc...

* New image operations: "alienify", "blur", "contrast", "edge_detect", "enboss", "equalize", "flip",
    "gamma_correct", "mirror", "negate", "nosify", "rotate", "sharpen", "to_blob" inherited from
    devil library see devil documentation at http://rdoc.info/github/banister/devil/master/Devil/Image

NOTE: imageruby-devil requires imageruby-bmp or imageruby-bmp-c gems in order to to work

== Installation

No explicit require is needed, examples

  require "imageruby"

  include ImageRuby

  # create image (red gradient and random green)
  image = Image.new(255,255) {|x,y| Color.from_rgb(x,rand(200),0) }

  # save image on png format
  image.save("image.png", :png)

=== Example 2: Blur and mirror

  require "imageruby"

  include ImageRuby

  # load image generated in the previous example
  image = Image.from_file("image.png")
